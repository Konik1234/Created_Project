- GUI Application TO-DO-LIST
- Part of the Weather Station Project


## Inverted Pendulum Project

This project involved the construction of a physical model of an inverted pendulum. The project included creating a simulation in MATLAB Simulink to test the pendulum's operation, followed by its construction through the implementation of mechanical, electrical, and software components:


**Skills:**

- Arduino programming
- Reading technical documentation
- Manual skills (handling tools)
- MATLAB, Simulink
- Basic of electronic

## RPG Game Project

The project involved creating an RPG game focused on, among other things, defeating randomly generated enemies, upgrading skills, and gaining new levels. The project aimed to utilize an object-oriented programming approach.

**Skills:**

- C++ programming
- Object-oriented programming
## GUI Application TO-DO-LIST

The goal was to create an application presenting a "To-do List." The implementation utilized the "wxWidgets" library. The application features buttons, sliders, checkboxes, and file reading and writing, among other functionalities.

**Skills:**

- C++ programming
- Object-oriented programming
- Visual Studio
## Part of the Weather Station Project

The weather station was a project I worked on in a group of four. The project involved reading weather information from a website, sending it via the MQTT protocol to other members, and finally saving it in a database. My part involved receiving data from stations C2 and C3 and storing them in a FIFO queue. The data from the FIFO was periodically saved to a selected network database (the saving task was triggered by a timer).

## ðŸš€ About Me
Welcome to my Repository

I am a graduate in Mechatronics Engineering and currently a student of Automation and Robotics at the Master's level. I will be posting projects here that I work on, mainly related to programming but also involving 3D design and likely electrical schematics.

Have a pleasant visit!
